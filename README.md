# Mushroom Classification using Decision Tress
This analysis uses machine learning, specifically a decision tree algorithm, to classify mushrooms as either edibleor poisonous based on their physical characteristics. With many people foraging mushrooms for consumption orsale to restaurants, itâ€™s critical that novice foragers can accurately identify poisonous specimens. This report aims to develop a reliable classification model that can identify the key characteristics distinguishing edible frompoisonous mushrooms, providing clear guidelines for safe foraging.
